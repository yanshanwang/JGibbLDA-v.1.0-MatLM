[13] Neuropathy in fingers
I am getting so fed up and frustrated with the neuropathy I have. My feet have been painful for some time, but I have had treatment and special orthotics fitted, and they are better. But I now (think) I have neuropathy in my fingers, as the tips feel tight and painful, and the skin in areas feels burned. None of my doctors seems to know much nor seems particularly interested. This is getting me down - any advice?

[14] Cinnamon? 
I've read where cinnamon may be the best of the spices or supplements to use to reduce blood sugar. Any thoughts or experiences with cinnamon? I also read where tumaric and ginger may help as well, but that cinnamon had the best test results thus far. I was think on trying 2X 1000mg tabs a day over the next 3 months to see if there's any positive effects on my labs in June, even if it's just a few ticks off the blood sugar readings. Thanks.

[15] Metformin and High Blood sugar levels 
I was put on Metformin to control my blood sugars about two weeks ago. 500mg pill twice a day. After logging my blood sugar levels for a week, the doctor told me to double the dosage. So now I am taking 1000mg twice a day and since doing that (for about 3 days) my blood sugars are still high, some even higher than they were before. Is there any reason that doubling the meds which are meant to lower your blood sugar would actually increase it, or would not have the same effect as a lower dosage? For any of you on Metformin, have you had any similar issues? Are you taking any other meds to help control things?

[16] Another A1C Question 
Last A1C test was 6.5 but the fasting blood sugar was 108 . I would have thought that both would have been up . Still confused as to whether this is pre diabetes or diabetes.

[17] bg effects on eyes 
I have had problems the last few months with my eyes being sensitive to light, but only after I have a rather heavy meal, usually lunch. I can be fine before I go into a restaurant, but then when I come out I have to squint very hard to even be able to walk to the car. Could this mean that the diabetes is starting to affect my eyes?
