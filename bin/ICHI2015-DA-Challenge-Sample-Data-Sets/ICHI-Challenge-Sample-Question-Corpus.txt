[113] Anyone ever had hypos on Metformin 
I'm on Metformin for my diabetes but have lost weight over the past 2 years, at my last annual check up I expected they would review my meds due to the weight loss but they say that my blood sugars are good and they want to keep me on the Metformin as its working and doing its job well. Increasingly over the last couple of months I've been experiencing what only seems like 'low blood sugars' dizzy spells, extreme hunger pangs that make me experience nausea (like the morning sickness nausea that low blood sugars cause whilst pregnant) so I bought some test sticks for my glucose meter this week and have been testing since yesterday. So far it seems my blood sugars are on the low scale, not quite what you would call hypo levels but considering I've only taken them whilst sat at home or at my desk I would imagine they probably drop lower when I'm active. I've been told that I will not suffer Hypos on Metformin, but with these readings I am starting to think that maybe I might be now suffering with low blood sugars even though I'm eating a well balanced diet throughout the day. Does anyone else experience symptoms on Metformin?

[114] New here, A1C of 7.4 
I have been going through a battery of tests because of some very swollen axillary and supraclavicular lymph nodes. Obviously they are looking for cancer. I've had ultrasounds, chest Xray, diagnostic mammogram, scheduled for a lymph node removal in a few weeks. My doctor had to leave town for a family emergency, so I can't contact her for a few days. I have been under a great deal of stress for about a year, also on meds for panic disorder and generalized anxiety. The surgeon I met with yesterday said my A1C was 7.4, and I am diabetic. Right now I am on an antibiotic to see if the lymph nodes are reacting to some unknown bacterial infection.Can all of this stuff going on contribute to a higher reading? My fasting BG has always been normal, last checked a year ago.

[115] When to take fast acting insulin? 
I've had diabetes for around 10 years. I have been on Metformin since the beginning, then Levemir, and the doctor recently added Lyxumia and Apidra, the latter to take before having carbs. I am struggling a bit to know when to take Apidra (e.g. before a Coke, or a cake, or just before meals with carbs). I do allow myself the odd treat. In order to manage my BG levels, is it OK to top up the Apidra a few times a day to get to know how it works with my system, or could that screw up my BG? If anyone else is on this, could they help?

I have been stressed and sleep deprived for the past 2 and a half months and have more or less been shoving random carb things into my mouth. Does anyone think this might be a recurrence of neuropathy?
